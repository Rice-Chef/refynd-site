  <p class="date">Last updated: February 2026</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By downloading, installing, or using the ReFynd mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>ReFynd is a platform that connects clients with beauty and wellness professionals. The App allows clients to discover professionals through video content, view portfolios, book appointments, send messages, and leave reviews. Professionals can showcase their work, manage bookings, and communicate with clients.</p>
  <p>ReFynd acts as an intermediary platform and is not itself a provider of beauty or wellness services.</p>

  <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 16 years of age to use ReFynd. By creating an account, you confirm that you are at least 16 years old and that the information you provide is accurate and complete.</p>

  <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account information.</p>
  <p>You may only create one account per person. Accounts are non-transferable.</p>

  <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>

    <li>Post false, misleading, or fraudulent information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, with or without notice.</p>

  <h2>6. Professional Listings</h2>
  <p>Professionals are responsible for the accuracy of their profile information, including services offered, pricing, availability, and qualifications. ReFynd does not verify the qualifications, licences, or insurance of professionals listed on the platform.</p>
  <p>Clients are advised to verify a professional's qualifications and conduct their own due diligence before booking an appointment.</p>

  <h2>7. Bookings and Appointments</h2>
  <p>Bookings made through ReFynd are agreements between the client and the professional. ReFynd facilitates the booking process but is not a party to the agreement between client and professional.</p>
  <p>Cancellation policies are set by individual professionals. Please review the professional's cancellation policy before booking.</p>
  <p>ReFynd is not responsible for the quality, safety, or outcome of any services provided by professionals.</p>

  <h2>8. User Content</h2>
  <p>By uploading content (including videos, images, reviews, and messages) to ReFynd, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to use, display, and distribute that content within the App for the purpose of operating and promoting the platform.</p>
  <p>You retain ownership of your content. You may remove your content at any time by deleting it from the App or by requesting account deletion.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these Terms or is reported by other users.</p>

  <h2>9. Reviews and Ratings</h2>
  <p>Reviews must be honest, fair, and based on genuine experiences. We reserve the right to remove reviews that are fraudulent, abusive, or violate these Terms. Professionals may not offer incentives in exchange for positive reviews.</p>

  <h2>10. Messaging</h2>
  <p>The messaging feature is provided for communication related to services and bookings. Users must not use messaging for spam, harassment, or any purpose unrelated to the platform's intended use.</p>

  <h2>11. Reporting and Blocking</h2>
  <p>Users can report profiles or content that violates these Terms. Reports are reviewed and action will be taken where appropriate. Users can also block other users to prevent further communication.</p>

  <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The ReFynd name, logo, and all associated branding, design, and software are the intellectual property of ReFynd. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on any part of the App without our written permission.</p>

  <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>ReFynd is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>

  <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes through the App. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>
